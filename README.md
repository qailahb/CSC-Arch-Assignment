CSC2002S Architecture Assignment 1

This project contains two MIPS programs that process 64x64 PPM images: one increases the brightness of colour images, and the other converts colour images to greyscale.

--------------------------------------------------------------

The programs can both be run by first inserting the absolute file path by input_file and output_file in the .data section at the top of the programs. 

Note: The code does sometimes take quite long to run, I have tried to improve this but have unfortunately not been successful.
